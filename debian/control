Description: opm-grid library -- development files
 opm-grid is intended to enable working with corner-point or, more
 generally, pillar grids in dune. A standard grid type in the petroleum
 industry, corner-point grids fill space with a relatively low number
 of cells while still providing sufficient flexibility to model faults,
 fractures and erosion. The grid format was originally designed with
 an eye towards geological modelling rather than numerical simulation
 and this design choice does limit the number of feasible numerical
 methods.
